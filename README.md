# bursting-neurons
Bursting, or burst firing, is an extremely diverse general phenomenon of the activation patterns of neurons.
you can check [bursting page on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bursting) for more information.

In 1982, Hindmarsh and Rose described a two-variable model of the action potential which is a modification of Fitzhughâ€™s B.v.P model in and explained how the close proximity of the nullclines can be exploited to give a qualitative explanation for burst generation. The Hindmarsh-Rose model is known to reproduce all dynamical behaviors, such as *quiescence*, *spiking*, *bursting*, *irregular spiking*, and *irregular bursting*.
